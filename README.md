# 63-Years-of-Seismicity-in-California
A data driven exploration of earthquakes in California and surrounding regions from 1960 to 2023 (September) with data from the IRIS network.

The state of California is one of the most seismically active regions in the United States, owing much to its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire. The region is intersected by several major fault lines, including the San Andreas Fault, the Hayward Fault, and the San Jacinto Fault, among others. These fault systems are a part of the larger boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate.

Seismicity in California is characterized by frequent low to moderate magnitude earthquakes and the occasional significant seismic event. The interaction between the plates not only results in earthquakes but also has given rise to various topographical features, including mountain ranges and basins.

Historically, California has experienced several devastating earthquakes, including the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, and the 1994 Northridge earthquake. These events caused considerable damage and loss of life, highlighting the seismic risk in the region.

To make the state a safer place to live, California has implemented stringent building codes and has invested in early warning systems and public education on earthquake preparedness. Seismic research in the state is at the forefront, with many institutions and organizations continuously monitoring seismic activity and working towards improving the understanding and prediction of earthquakes in the region. The California Institute of Technology is one institution at the forefront of earthquake research in the region.

The study of seismicity in California has a bright future, leading to a future predictive science that might one day accurately foresee the impact of future seismic events, enabling a culture of true predictive preparedness and resilience in the face of an ever present Californian seismicity.

In this data driven study we use data from the IRIS network to characterize the past 63 years of seismicity in California, using the full temporal range available in the IRIS network as accessed through the ObsPy Python library. 

The IRIS (Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology) database is a comprehensive resource for earthquake data and related seismological information. It is maintained by a consortium of research institutions and provides a vast collection of seismic data, which can be accessed through various methods, including the ObsPy Python library (https://pypi.org/project/obspy/).

The code to produce all these visualizations of seismicity in California can be found in the Jupyter notebook in this repo. Enjoy!

It is interesting to note a few things. First, Major Californian earthquakes are not overly deep. Secondly, large earthquakes (i.e., over 7.0) picked up in the region starting around 1990. Topics for future studies!
